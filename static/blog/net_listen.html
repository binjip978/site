        <h1>Go networking interfaces</h1>

        <p>Go has a high level networking API and not provide socket API from net package, you can reach them via
            syscall package if you need, but instead Go provide primitives like net.Dial, net.Listen that give a
            net.Conn interface, but this interface will have generic Read/Write method but their behaviour depends on
            underlying connection.

        <p>Example of a simple UDP server, that try to respond to client:

        <pre>
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "net"
)

func main() {
    conn, err := net.ListenUDP("udp", &net.UDPAddr{Port: 1234})
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    b := make([]byte, 1024)
    for {
        n, err := conn.Read(b)
        if err != nil {
            log.Println(err)
        }

        fmt.Printf("Received: %s\n", b[:n])

        n, err = conn.Write([]byte("Hello from server"))
        if err != nil {
            log.Println(n, err)
        }
    }
}
</pre>

        <p> If we connect to the server using netcat we will be able to read data from a client, but it will fail to
            send "Hello from server".

        <pre>
nc -u 127.0.0.1 1234
hello

./server
Received: hello
2024/01/14 09:40:24 0 write udp [::]:1234: write: destination address required
</pre>

        <p> The error is "EDESTADDRREQ The socket is not connection-mode, and no peer address is set.", this fix is
            simple if you plan to respond the the client you better to know client address, this can be done by using
            UDPConn ReadFrom and WriteTo methods. This is expected because UDP is connectionless, but when I see method
            like Write I expect to be able to send response.

        <pre>
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "net"
)

func main() {
    conn, err := net.ListenUDP("udp", &net.UDPAddr{Port: 1234})
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    b := make([]byte, 1024)
    for {
        n, addr, err := conn.ReadFromUDP(b)
        if err != nil {
            log.Println(err)
        }

        fmt.Printf("Received: %s\n", b[:n])

        n, err = conn.WriteToUDP([]byte("Hello from server"), addr)
        if err != nil {
            log.Println(n, err)
        }
    }
}
</pre>

        <pre>
nc -u 127.0.0.1 1234
hello
Hello from server^C

./server
Received: hello    
</pre>

        <p>Actually in Linux it's possible to create a connected socket over an unconnected one <a
                href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-udp-sockets-but-were-afraid-to-ask-part-1">everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-udp-sockets-but-were-afraid-to-ask-part-1</a>,
            but it's quite hacky and require reaching syscall package.

        <p>But the problem we no longer have generic net.Conn interface and Read/Write works only in one way.
